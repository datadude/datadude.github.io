## Social Night:

### The Social Night  everyone got to know each other in a casual atmosphere, with a twilight dinner, a view, and most importantly, beer.

### Of course Friday night was not just about fun.  We had the serious business of picking teams for the next day.

#### First up was the pitches by the "founders".
* These are the "Idea Guys" they all had a problem that needed to be solved, or an idea for an app, etc.
* They each stood in front of everyone and "pitched" their idea to everyone in the room.
* They needed to attract talent to their idea.

#### Next was team formation.
* free-for-all
* If a particular idea attracted your attention you could talk to the founder about being on the team.
* No more that five per team, so if you wanted a popular team you might have to pitch yourself and your ideas to the founder.


### Saturday morning, the work begins

#### Our team, well most of us, missing our founder.

#### Putting it together

* We were assigned an area to work in and "desk".
* The idea is to brain-storm an application to fulfill a real need.
* The main thing that you are looking for is to put together a presentation.
* This is where you come up with a story to tell and hopefully some code to back it up.
* Don't try to live demo.

### Saturday Evening

#### An address from the Dept of Energy
