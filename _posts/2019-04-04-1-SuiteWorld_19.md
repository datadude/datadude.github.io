## Key Take Aways from SuiteWorld 2019

This week I had the opportunity to travel to the annual "SuiteWorld" Netsuite conference in Las Vegas.
I like to attend this conference yearly, mainly to stay abreast of all the latest updates to the vast netsuite offering.
This year I thought that it would be good to share my impressions of the conference and callout some key take aways for 
all the folks that could not make it. 

The heart of my observations will be directed at features for Netsuite Admins and Developers, however, there is much here that
I will flag for Supply Chain, and Financial professionals.

I go to SuiteWorld for four major things:

- **The product Keynote**
  - This is where we are basically shown a demo of all of the latest, and upcoming features in netsuite, in the context 
  of "Real World" scenarios. 
- **The breakout sessions.**
  - Breakout sessions are where we hear about the feature demoed in the keynote in more depth, and much more.
  - This is where we can get an idea of the breadth of Netsuite's offerings.  I you don't go to suiteword you would 
  never know all of the things that they do.   
- **The expo floor**
  - The Expo floor is where all the action is. You can touch base with all of your current Netsuite vendors in one space.
- **The pre event training:**
  - On Sunday and Monday before the event.
  - All of the netsuite certification classes are offered. 
  - "Deep Dives" into important subjects and individual features of the Netsuite platform.   
- **Hackathon:** In addtion to the above, this year I added the "Hackathon for Good".  This is where a teams of Netsuite experts compete to 
  to solve problems for a non profit.  The best solution wins that team a prize and prestege.
- **Networking events.**  There are several networking events scheduled mostly around the Netsuite "Verticals".
  I normally go to the Retail cocktail hour and have always found it quite informative.  Here you will get to speak to 
  other netsuite users in an informal atmosphere of a cocktail party.  Beleive it or not most of the conversations do 
  revolve around Netsuite and peoples experiences using and implementing it. 
  
### Product Keynote Video
I have indexed the 1.5 hour video so you don't have to watch it all to get what you need.  A click on the images below 
will take you right to the important parts.  Based on what I gained at the breakout sessions I have listed a few key 
highlights of that section of the key note.

#### Supply Chain new features.

This is a product demo showing off some new, and upcomming features in Netsuite, this video moves pretty fast, mixing 
features that are just now available with some that are still undre development:

[ ![Supply Chain](http://img.youtube.com/vi/fFPJ9bTF9RA/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/embed/fFPJ9bTF9RA?start=930&end=1373)

- The video starts with a customer segmentation analysis in the new Netsuite workbook available in 1029.1 
- Next it displays a new "Intelligent Analysis" with "built in intelligence" that infers some type of AI tech, 
this is not yet available, so should be taken with a grain of salt.  
- Next up is the supply chain stuff, with a demonstration of the "Automatic Location Assignment" feature.  
The engine for this has been under development for a while and is maturing nicely.  It looks like they are surfacing it 
right to the PO line item level with a real time assignment of the location for an item.
- Moving right along to workorder and PO creation, I think that most of this is available today.
- Order Allocation strategies are next and should be available in 2019.2.
- The workforce demo is really all about the new "Workbook" functionality combined with last year's "Suite People" update.

#### Warehouse Management Demo.

- Wave Picking.
- Warehouse app.
- Most of this should be available by 2019.2 release.   


#### Financials: Approvals Process

Financial pros might want to have at these two cuts, the focus this year I think was a new approval process builder
 and also supporting new lease standards

- No word on when exactly this will be available probably 2020.1
- Also there are some interesting changes to the back end of how netsuite will handle third party tax engines.  
  Look for more partners besides Avalara in the future. 
  
#### Expense reporting improvements and Planning and budgeting 
 
[ ![PBCS]({{site.url}}/assets/images/suiteworld19/PBCS.png)](https://www.youtube.com/embed/fFPJ9bTF9RA?start=4036&end=4383)

- International Expense reporting 2019.2
- Cash management banking roadmap, really just a vision statement.  
- Next up is the Oracle Planning and Budgeting module.
  - This is really an Oracle offering outside of netsuite.
  - Pulls data out of Netsuite through a native connection
  - synchronizaton back into Netsuite is done through CSV upload.

#### Platform  

Here they talk about the underlying technology that is driving the changes that you see in the above demonstrations.
Also they are continuing to update the frameworks that make customizing and connecting to Netsuite easier to do and manintain.
  
[ ![Platform]({{site.url}}/assets/images/suiteworld19/platform.png)](https://www.youtube.com/embed/fFPJ9bTF9RA?start=4400&end=5065)

- We start with infrastructure improvements that are on-going.
  - Oracle has already started making moves in the background over the last six months to enable a move onto the Oracle 
    platform and Data Centers.  The recent change inthe URL structure was key to that.
- In the future you will be able to choose the date and time of your updates.     
- Improved sandbox refreshes.
- Improvements to the performance monitoring.
- Page Builder (2019.2): A way to build custom views and of netsuite data (within Netsuite) with drag and drop capability.
- A better way to manage customizations to netsuite.  This is dependent on your Admin or Partner actually building it 
  with the new SDF.
   
#### Hackathon

This year I had the opportunity to particitpate in the "Hackathon For Good" at Suiteworld.  I teamed up with an Awesome 
group of developers and admins to produce a great solution for a great non-profit, and win the event!
